/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Remove the backslash from the notes property.
 *
 * 2) Take a look at the errors reported by JS Bin.
 *
 * 3) Put the backslash back.
 *
 * 4) See how the location property doesn't need
 *    a backslash. What happens if you add one and
 *    log the location property?
 *
 * 5) What if you want to show a backslash
 *    as part of a string?
