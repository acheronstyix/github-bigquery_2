# 2) For every executable you should have a h90,H90,f90 or F90 file that    #
#    contains a main routine and whose filename matches exactly the name    #
#    of the executable. These main files can be placed anywhere in your     #

#OPTIONAL, only needed in case you have sources that need to be compiled separately
#from the Hybrid Fortran sources. Please note that it's perfectly fine to have non-Hybrid .f, .F, .f90 or .F90 files
#in your $SRC_DIR_COMMON - however you might have a project with a build system that's too complex to be fully integrated
#into Hybrid Fortran, so this allows your build system to be spawned as a child of the Hybrid Fortran build system
#The goal is to still have a consistent 'make', 'make install', 'make tests', etc. interface in the root directory.

#This makefile will be executed *after* the compilation of CPU/GPU specialized Hybrid Fortran libraries

#$BASEDIR/gpu directory.
#
#This makefile should expose the following target:
# *) after_hybrid_build (will be called after the files in $BASEDIR/XXX/$SRC_DIR_COMMON have been compiled. This should produce an executable
#    based on the library / object files in $BASEDIR/XXX/$SRC_DIR_COMMON as well as your other sources within FRAMEWORK_DIRS that you need to take
