{"summary": "Physiology is the study of how living things work.", "full_text": "Physiology  is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and bio-molecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field it is divided into, among others, animal physiology , plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology , bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline since 1901 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.", "title": "Physiology"}
